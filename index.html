        <p>Hi, and welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at the California Institute of Technology, advised by <a href="http://tamuz.caltech.edu
">Omer Tamuz</a>. My research interests lie in the field of microeconomic theory, with a specific focus on information and social learning.</p>
        
		<p> I received my Bachelor of Economics (with First Class Honors) from the University of Queensland in 2018, advised by <a href="https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/2437">Priscilla Man</a> and  <a href="https://economics.uq.edu.au/profile/2264/jeffrey-kline">Jeffrey Kline</a>. Prior to that, I studied Economics at Shandong University. </p>
		
		<p> <b>I will be joining the Department of Economics at Monash University (Melbourne, Australia) as an Assistant Professor in September 2024. </b> </p>

		<em>Abstract:</em> We study whether individuals can learn the informativeness of their information 
technology through social learning. As in the classic sequential social learning
model, rational agents arrive in order and make decisions based on the past actions of
others and their private signals. There is uncertainty regarding the informativeness of
the common signal-generating process. We show that learning in this setting is not guaranteed,
and depends crucially on the relative tail distributions of private beliefs induced
by uninformative and informative signals. We identify the phenomenon of perpetual
disagreement as the cause of learning and provide a characterization of learning in the
canonical Gaussian environment.			 </div>

<em>Abstract:</em> We study how fads emerge from social learning in a changing environment.
We consider a simple sequential learning model in which rational agents arrive in order,
each acting only once, and the underlying unknown state is constantly evolving. Each
agent receives a private signal, observes all past actions of others, and chooses an action
to match the current state. Since the state changes over time, cascades cannot last
forever, and actions fluctuate too. We show that in the long run, actions change more
often than the state. This describes many real-life faddish behaviors in which people
often change their actions more frequently than what is necessary.
